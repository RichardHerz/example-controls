process_plotter.js only differs in profile and strip plots in an IF block selecting where to get data - from profileData or stripData array 

As far as plotting, these data arrays are same except that they may differ in number of variables and points.

In order to make plotter more general, consider adding a property of plot description in plot_info that specifies which array to get data... *BUT* that is exactly what I'm doing now... 

How to change plotter to eliminate IF and explicit refs to profileData and stripData? 

Maybe change plotsObj[plotsObjNum]['type'] to point to actual name of data array and not simply profile or strip. Or somewhere else in plot_info, point profile to array name profileData...
