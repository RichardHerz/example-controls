# example-controls
Individual examples of basic controls in web simulations.

We use client-side technology (html, css, javascript) with no, or few, external libraries. We use these controls to develop interactive simulations of physical systems for active learning.

Examples of individual controls are shown here so they are easier to inspect and understand than those embedded in a complete simulation.

See source files of a complete simulation at our reaction-diffusion project here at github.
